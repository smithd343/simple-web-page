      <h1>Maharana Pratap</h1>
      <h2>9 May 1540 - 19 January 1597</h2>
      <h3>Maharana Pratap was a renowned Rajput warrior and a king of Mewar, Rajasthan, in north-western India.</h3>
      <div id="example">
         <p id="italic"> One of the greatest Rajput warriors, he is recognised for resisting the attempts of the Mughal ruler Akbar to conquer his territory. Unlike the other neighbouring Rajput rulers, Maharana Pratap repeatedly refused to submit to the mighty Mughals and continued fighting courageously till his last breath. A symbol of Rajput gallantry, diligence and valour, he was the only Rajput warrior to take on the might of Akbar, the Mughal Emperor. For all his courage, sacrifice and fiercely independent spirit, he is honoured as a hero in Rajasthan. </p>
